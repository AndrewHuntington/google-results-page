# Google Results Page Clone (Project HTML/CSS - Difficult)

> HTML/CSS Project
>
> A loose recreation of the Google.com search results page.
>
> Layout almost entirely done using CSS Grid, for better or worse.
>
> Some corners were cut, and the CSS is not DRY and could use a refactor, but I want to move on to JS and Ruby.
